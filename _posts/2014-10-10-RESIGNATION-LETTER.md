##1.RESIGNATION LETTER
~~~
Dear:
    I regret that I give my official resignation to the company at this time.   
    I came to the company nearly two years, and I'm very honored to be able to become a member of our company.
    I'm very grateful that the company gave me such a good environment to work and I learned a lot. 
    The decision was a difficult one for me because I have so enjoyed my working relationships here. 
    But due to my personal and my family reason, I have to leave BeiJing.
    Therefore, please accept my resignation.
    I hope my applications can be approved before June 12.

    Yours sincerely, 
    XXX,XXX
